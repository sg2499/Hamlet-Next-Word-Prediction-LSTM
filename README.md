This repository presents an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that performs **next word prediction** using **LSTM** on a dataset derived from *The Tragedie of Hamlet* by William Shakespeare. The model learns to predict the next likely word given an input phrase using sequential modeling.

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Dataset:** Shakespeare's *Hamlet* (raw text corpus)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal
  - Tokenization and sequence padding
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Embedding Layer
  - LSTM Layer
  - Dense (Softmax Output) Layer
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Goal:** Predict the next word in a sentence from the learned Shakespearean style

> ⚠️ **Note:** Achieving very high accuracy is inherently challenging due to the poetic and non-standard nature of the Hamlet text.

## 📚 Dataset – Hamlet

The raw Shakespearean text of *Hamlet* is used as the training corpus. It is stored in `hamlet.txt`. This dataset features:
- Rich and archaic vocabulary
- Complex syntax and structure
- Ideal for training stylistic LSTM models

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Refer to `requirements.txt` for all dependencies. Major libraries used include:

- `tensorflow==2.15.0`
- `streamlit==1.34.0`
- `numpy`, `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`, `nltk`

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Literature + AI fusion using NLP
- LSTM-based neural architecture
- Streamlit-based real-time interaction
- Shakespearean text modeling challenge
